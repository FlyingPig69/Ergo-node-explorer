**Node Explorer**

Initially built to quickly inspect boxes on the blockchain in a nicely formatted layout, but grew to something MUCH bigger!!

Try it out here: https://ergo-node-explorer.vercel.app/
Note that vercel limits execution time to 10s so some larger queries will timeout. The public node also gets busy which can slow things down.
For best experience run against local indexed node in which case it's quite speedy!

This queries the main explorer node and might be slow, best experience is to use again your own local indexed node.
