**Node Explorer**

Alpha version, final version will be released in two weeks from you reading this.

Initially built to quickly inspect boxes on the blockchain in a nicely formatted layout. 
Will add more features over time.

This queries the main explorer node and might be slow, best experience is to use again your own local indexed node.
